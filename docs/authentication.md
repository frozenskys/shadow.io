# Authenticating a U-Shadow

U-Shadows represent and act on the behalf of individual users. Just as individuals trust one another, it's important that U-Shadows trust one another too. 

## Setting up trust

The creation of a trust relationship always begins with one person asking their U-Shadow to establish a connection with another. This can be done as part of an action such as sending a file or as an explicit act. 

Direct Trust

If two people meet at a conference or a party etc. they could agree to link their U-Shadows.
