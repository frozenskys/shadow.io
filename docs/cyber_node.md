Shadow - A protocol for individual cyber shadows
================================================

A cyber shadow, or U-Shadow, is a concept taken directly from the works of the science fiction author Peter F. Hamilton. A person's U-Shadow is their interface to the internet. At present, a person typically interacts with the internet using a browser, but more and more services are building on top of the internet, using just the data and infrastructure. 

I have an idea for a service that can serve an individual directly. A user's U-Shadow could be used to perform lots of functions.

* Purchase goods on demand (at the best price for example)
* Perform internet searches
* Communicate with other people's U-Shadows to perform basic tasks
	- Simplify file transfers between individuals
	- Make appointments for lunch or drinks & negotiate the best times automatically
	- Leave messages
	- Establish trust or identity for an individual (using keys for encryption etc)

Internet nodes
==============
An internet node could be provided by a city. The node would offer a range of services, populated by all the providers in a particular city e.g. news, taxis , food delivery, laundry etc.. On arrival in a new city, a user could "register" their presence and be made aware of the services on offer.

Service Providers
* Register services (must conform to a given interface)

UShadow interfaces
* Search for services and users
* Perform actions.
