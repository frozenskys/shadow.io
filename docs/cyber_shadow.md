#A U-Shadow

A U-Shadow is an person's interface to the internet. It acts for, and on-behalf, of an individual. Whilst not fully autonomous, they can possess a certain level of autonomy when accomplishing certain tasks.

## User Interaction

A user can interact with their U-Shadow by using a defined protocol. Any application can implement this protocol and offer access to a user's U-Shadow. This application could be based on any technology e.g. web, mobile or desktop. This will allow for higher level interfaces to be developed over time without changing how the core of the U-Shadow functions.

## Searching

A user can issue a search into the internet using their own U-Shadow. Their U-Shadow can implement their own search routines, reaching out to search engines such as Google or Bing, but also reaching out into nearby Cyber Nodes, which can, in turn, process the search. The results of a search can then undergo further sorting and filtering by the U-Shadow, before the results are presented to the user.

## Services

A U-Shadow will provide its user with an abstract view of available services. These services can be discovered by requesting information for other Cyber Nodes or by a user making its U-Shadow aware of the service directly. Services will typically be offered by Cyber Nodes. 

## Messaging

U-Shadows can act as an individual's personal message keeper. By managing all of a user's communications, messages can be analysed and organised by the U-Shadow, presenting a very customised view to a user. It will also reduce the overhead of managing and multiple e-mail and IM accounts and programs.

## Identification

Since U-Shadows are coupled directly to an individual user, a U-Shadow can act as point of trust when establishing identity. The identity of another individual's U-Shadow can also be checked and trusted if appropriate, especially in the realm of inter U-Shadow communication. 

## Other U-Shadows

U-Shadows will able to invoke services within another individual's U-Shadow assuming there is a trusted connection between the two. This would allow for trusted messaging, direct messaging, file transfer and the invocation of other services. Perhaps one user wishes to make an appointment with another. A user's U-Shadow could accomplish this task directly.
