A protocol that will form the basic of personal cyber shadows and cyber nodes.

# What is a cyber shadow?

A Cyber Shadow is a individual's interface to the internet, providing the user with several services and acting as gate keeper and assistant. Whilst Cyber Shadows are not intended to be autonomous, they can possess a certain level of intelligence and autonomy.

# What is a cyber node?

A Cyber Node is nexus point of the internet. It could represent your home, a bar, a city or a country. An individual's Cyber Shadow would also form a node to some degree. The Cyber Node could provide access to services and information pertinent to its purpose.

For example, a city level Cyber Node could

- Allow users to hail a taxi.
- Provide local news.
- Check travel information.
- Discover information about other Cyber Nodes in the city.
- Process search queries through itself and it's child nodes.

Cyber Nodes would be self organising i.e. bars could register themselves with cities and cities could register themselves with countries. Starting at top level node, it should be possible to issue a query and have that query passed through all sub-level nodes automatically. 

## Cyber Node Services

A Cyber Node would provide a list of services, depending on its scale and size. A city cyber node could provide access to emergency services or provide information about takeaways that have registered themselves with the city's node.
