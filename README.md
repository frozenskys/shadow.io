#Shadow.io - A protocol for cyber shadows and cyber nodes

A cyber shadow, or U-Shadow, is a concept taken directly from the works of the science fiction author Peter F. Hamilton. A person's U-Shadow is their interface to the internet. At present, a person typically interacts with the internet using a browser, but more and more services are building on top of the internet, using just the data and infrastructure.

## What Shadow.io all about?

In order for concepts like these to become a reality, a framework of basic communication protocols is required to establish a base from which to build upon. Shadow is an attempt to put this groundwork in place.

## What is a U-Shadow?

A Cyber Shadow is a individual's interface to the internet, providing the user with several services and acting as gate keeper and assistant. Whilst Cyber Shadows are not intended to be autonomous, they can possess a certain level of intelligence and autonomy.

## What is a cyber node?

A Cyber Node is nexus point of the internet. It could represent your home, a bar, a city or a country. An individual's Cyber Shadow would also form a node to some degree. The Cyber Node could provide access to services and information pertinent to its purpose.
